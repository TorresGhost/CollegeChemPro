\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}T}{he} previous chapter have covered the chemical properties of what we call inorganic compounds. These are for example cooking salt (\ce{NaCl}), water (\ce{H2O}) or ammonia (\ce{NH3}). This chapter covers organic compounds, which are chemicals based on carbon and hydrogen. We used organic compounds in the form of numerous materials such as fuels, perfumes, plastics or drugs. They all have common properties, from their smells to their powerful action. We will address first the naming of organic compounds as well as the properties of these important chemicals. Finally we will address the different groups of functional atoms that give unique properties to molecules such as caffeine or cocaine.

\section{\color{blue!30!black}{Alkanes}}
This first section will introduce organic chemistry, covering the most simple organic compounds: the alkanes. Alkanes simply contain carbon and hydrogen and are also called hydrocarbons. First you will be introduced to a few organic chemicals without paying to much attention to their names. Then, you will learn about a series of different organic formulas that can represent the same compound. Finally, you will learn the naming rule of alkanes, which basically extend to other--more complex--organic chemicals.

?\begin{description}
\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil Identifying organic compounds}{Identifying organic compounds}] How do we know when we have an organic or an inorganic chemical? Organic chemicals are based on carbon and hydrogen. They can contain other nonmetallic elements such as oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur. Here a few examples: \ce{CH4}, \ce{C2H6}, \ce{C6H6} or \ce{CH3COOH}. Mind that carbonates (\ce{Na2CO3}), carbon monoxide (\ce{CO}) or carbon dioxide (\ce{CO2}) are not organic compounds. 

\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil Methane}{Methane}] The simplest organic compound is methane: \ce{CH4}. Methane is a fuel and the main constituent of natural gas. Going back a few chapters, the Lewis structure of methane is:
\begin{center}\chemfig{C(-[2]H)(-[4]H)(-[6]H)(-[8]H)}\hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{Methane, \ce{CH4}}\end{center}
This structure is very representative in this chapter as it shows that each carbon atom has to be connected to four different atoms.

\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil Alkanes}{Alkanes}] Alkanes are simple organic compounds made of Carbon and Hydrogen with all carbons connected by means of simple bonds--these are single lines to represent the connections between atoms. The naming of alkanes results of adding a prefix to the sufix \emph{ane}. The prefix depends on the number of carbons in the molecule. Table \ref{table12:2} shows a list of the different prefixes. For example, the alkane with one carbon is called methane. Another example of alkanes would be ethane that contains two carbons:
\begin{center}\chemfig{C(-[2]H)(-[4]H)(-[6]H)-C(-[2]H)(-[6]H)-H} \hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{Ethane, \ce{C2H6}}\end{center}
or propane:
\begin{center}\chemfig{C(-[2]H)(-[4]H)(-[6]H)-C(-[2]H)(-[6]H)-C(-[2]H)(-[6]H)-H} \hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{Propane, \ce{C3H8}}\end{center}

\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil General formula for alkanes}{General formula for alkanes}] At this point we saw two different alkanes: methane (\ce{CH4}), butane (\ce{C2H6}) and propane (\ce{C3H8}). The general formula for an alkane with $n$ carbon atoms is:

\begin{equation}
 \text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n+2}

\newpage
\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil Alkanes contain \ce{CH3} and \ce{CH2} units}{Alkanes contain \ce{CH3} and \ce{CH2} units}] Let us analyze the formula of propane. In this formula there are two different types of carbons. One is the end of the chain carbon, in the left and in the right. The other type of carbon is the central carbon. The extremes are bounded to three hydrogen, whereas the central is bounded to two hydrogens.
\begin{center}\chemfig{C(-[2]@{B}H)(-[4]@{A}H)(-[6]H)-C(-[2]H@{E})(-[6]H)-C(-[2]H@{C})(-[6]H)-H@{D}} \end{center}

The extremes are indeed \ce{CH3} units and the center is a \ce{CH2} unit. So, another way to represent ethane would be:
\begin{center}\chemfig{CH_3-!{CH2}-CH_3} \hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{Ethane, \ce{C2H6}}\end{center}
At this point you have seen three different ways to represent organic molecules. Let us use propane as an example. One is the  \emph{molecular formula}, which in the case of propane is \ce{C3H8}. Another different way to represent propane is with its \emph{expanded structural formula}, that is by representing all C and all H in the molecule. Another molecular representation is the \emph{condensed structural formula}, that is by using \ce{CH3} and \ce{CH2} units. Here the three formulas:

\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil ZigZag}{ZigZag}] Let us analyze the structure of propane again. This molecule has three carbons in the form of a C-C chain such as: C-C-C. However, C-C chains with more than more three carbons are not linear. So instead of representing propane as:
\begin{center}\chemfig{H_3C-!{CH2}-CH_3} \end{center}
we could represent this molecule by means of a zigzag:

\begin{center}\chemfig{H_3C-[:45]!{CH2}-[:-45]CH_3} \hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{Propane, \ce{C3H8}}\end{center}
Another example would be butane:
\begin{center}\chemfig{H_3C-[:45]!{CH2}-[:-45]CH_2-[:45]CH_3} \hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{Butane, \ce{C4H10}}\end{center}

\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil Skeletal formula}{Skeletal formula}] A final way to represent molecules in this chapter is simply using lines. This is called the skeletal formula, as you only represent the C-C skeleton of the molecule. Let us use hexane an an example. We can represent this molecule as in this two ways:
\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}[help lines/.style={thin,draw=black!50}]
\node at (0,0) {\chemfig{H_3C-[:45]!{CH2}-[:-45]CH_2-[:45]CH_2-[:-45]CH_2-[:45]CH_3} };

\node at (6,0) {\chemfig{-[:45]-[:-45]-[:45]-[:-45]-[:45]}};
\node at (6,-2) {\textcolor{blue}{skeletal formula}};
\end{tikzpicture}\end{center}
The ending of a skeletal formula represents a \ce{CH3} and the points in between represents \ce{CH2}. 

\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX

\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\

\section{\color{blue!30!black}{Cycloalkanes}}
This section deals with cyclic alkanes. Alkanes are perfect examples of hydrocarbons, with C-C chains and all carbon atoms saturates with hydrogen. Cycloalkanes are in essence alkanes that have a cyclic structure. We will cover the molecular, condensed and skeletal formulas for these chemicals.

A cycloalkane results of eliminating the left and right hydrogen and connecting the molecule in the form of a cycle:

\section{\color{blue!30!black}{Alkanes with substituyents}}
At this point you should be familiar with alkanes. These organic compounds are carbon-based chemicals made of lines of C-C hydrocarbon chains. Often times these hydrocarbons have other groups of atoms attached to the hydrocarbon chains and these are called substituents. This section cover the naming of alkanes with substituents. Here an example of an alkane and an alkane with a substituent:
\begin{center}\chemname{\chemfig{CH_3-CH_2-CH_3}}{Propane}\hspace{1cm}
\chemname{\chemfig{CH_2(-[:90,1]NO_2)-CH_2-CH_3}}{Nitropropane}\end{center}
\sloppy
\begin{description}

\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil Substituents}{Substituents}] There are many different substituents which can be found connected to an alkane chain. Their names are indicated in Figure 1.8. The easiest substituents are halogens and atoms of chorine (\chemfig{Cl-[:0,1]}), bromine (\chemfig{Br-[:0,1]}) or iodine (\chemfig{I-[:0,1]}) can connect to an alkane. The name of these substituents is chloro, bromo and iodo. Other substituents can contain carbon, like a methyl (\chemfig{CH_3-[:0,1]}) or a ethyl (\chemfig{CH_3CH_2-[:0,1]}). There are even more complex substituents such as tert-butyl




\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil Alkanes with a single substituent}{Alkanes with a single substituent}] Let us consider the following example. The condensed formula for propane is
\begin{center} \chemfig{CH_3-CH_2-CH_3} \hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{Propane}\end{center}
Now, this would be propane with a substituent:
\begin{center} \chemfig{CH_2(-[:90,1]Br)-CH_2-CH_3} \hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{Bromopropane}\end{center}
As you can see a bromine atom substitutes one of the hydrogen atoms of the second first of the molecule (starting from the left).

\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil Alkanes with two or more equal substituents}{Alkanes with two or more equal substituents}] In the same way as when you have a single bromine atom attached to propane, you can also have two \chemfig{Br-[:0,1]}. In this case you need to use the prefix \emph{di} to indicate there are two identical bromines. For example, the name of the following molecule would be
\begin{center} \chemfig{CH(-[:90,1]Br)(-[:-90,1]Br)-CH_2-CH_3} \hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{Dibromopropane}\end{center}
Similarly, you should use the prefix \emph{tri} for three equal substituents.

\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Name the following hydrocarbon:
\begin{center} \chemfig{CH_3-CH_2-CH_2-CH(-[:90,1]I)(-[:-90,1]I)}\end{center}
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
The carbon chain has four carbons and hence the ending of the name would be: butane. Also there are two iodines (iodo substituents) attached to the carbon chain. As there are two of the same iodo atoms, we need to use the prefix \emph{di}. The full name would be: Dioiodobutane.
\\
\faDiamond\ \textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Study Check}} }\\
Name the following hydrocarbon:
\begin{center} \chemfig{CH_3-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-C(-[:0,1]F)(-[:90,1]F)(-[:-90,1]F)}\end{center}
\flushright{  \small Answer: Trifluoropentane. }
\end{example}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX



\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil Alkanes with different substituents}{Alkanes with different substituents}] 
Now imagine you have two different halogens as substituents: \chemfig{Br-[:0,1]} and \chemfig{I-[:0,1]} like in next example

\begin{center} \chemfig{CH(-[:90,1]Br)(-[:-90,1]I)-CH_2-CH_3}\end{center}
As they have different names you cannot use the prefix \emph{di}. Still, when you indicate the names of the substituents you need to order them according to the \emph{abc}. So bromo goes first in the name and iodo after. You also need to separate the different substituents with a '-'. The final name of the hydrocarbon above would be: Bromo-Iodopropane.



\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Name the following hydrocarbon:

The carbon chain has two carbons and hence the ending of the name would be: ethane. Also there are three different substituents: iodine (iodo substituents), bromine (bromo substituents) and fluorine (fluoro substituents). We need to order them according to the \emph{abc}, hence the order would be: bromo, then fluoro and finally iodo. The full name of the alkane would be: Bromo-Fluoro-Iodoethane.

\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil Numbering the chain}{Numbering the chain}] Substituents are atoms or groups of atoms that can plug into a alkane chain. You could envision plugging these atoms at different points of the chain. For example:
\begin{center} \chemfig{CH_3-CH(-[:90,1]Br)-CH_3} \hspace{0.5cm}or\hspace{0.5cm} \chemfig{CH_2(-[:90,1]Br)-CH_2-CH_3}\end{center}

In the right example Br is plugged to the left C atom, whereas in left example C is plugged to the middle carbon. Hence, it is important first, to learn how to number a hydrocarbon chain. Let us use propane as an example. This molecule has three atoms. In order to number the chain, you start by selecting the extreme that is the closest to the substituent, and use this carbon as number one. Next carbon would be carbon number two and so on until you arrive to carbon number three. 
\begin{center}\chemfig{C\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{1}}H(-[:90]Br)-C\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{2}}H_2-C\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{3}}H_3}\end{center}
As the Br atom in the carbon number one, the name of the molecule would be: 1-bromopropane or simply bromopropane. Differently, when the substituent is in a carbon different than one, you need to indicate that location. For example:

\begin{center} \chemfig{CH_3-CH(-[:90,1]Br)-CH_3} \hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{2-Bromopropane}\end{center}




\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Name the following hydrocarbon:
\begin{center} \chemfig{CH_3-CH(-[:90,1]CH_3)(-CH(-[:-90,1]I)-Br)}\end{center}
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
First we find the ending of the name: as the molecule has three carbons in the main chain, the ending of the name would be: propane. Then we need to number the chain so that the number one carbon is the closest to the substituents:
\begin{center} \chemfig{C\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{3}}H_3-C\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{2}}H(-[:90,1]CH_3)(-C\chemabove[2ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{1}}H(-[:-90,1]I)-Br)}\end{center}
A methyl is connected to carbon two, and two halogens, a iodo and a bromo are connected to carbon number one. The substituents are: 2-methyl, 1-bromo, 1-iodo. If we order them: 1-bromo-1-iodo-2-methyl. And the final name would be: 1-bromo-1-iodo-2-methylpropane.
\\

\end{example}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX




\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil Finding the longest chain}{Finding the longest the chain}] Alkanes with substituents are more complex than simple alkanes and often time they contain more than one hydrocarbon chain. Therefore, one can envision several ways to number the chain. The rule is to locate the longest chain. Let us use the following hydrocarbon. How many chains can you find, and which is the longest chain?

\begin{center} \chemfig{CH_3-CH_2-CH(-[:90]CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3)-CH_3} \end{center}
The answer should be three chains. Let me highlight the three different possibilities and the number of atoms in each chain:



\begin{center}
 \chemfig{@{A}CH_3-CH_2-CH(-[:90]CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3)-CH_3@{B}}\chemmove{
   \fill [fill=red, fill opacity=.1,line width=.00pt] ([xshift=0pt,yshift=-10pt]A.south west) rectangle ([xshift=0pt,yshift=10pt]B.north east) ;
}\hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{4 Carbons} \end{center}\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{center} \chemfig{@{A}CH_3-CH_2-C@{B}H(-[:90]C@{C}H_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3@{D})-CH_3}\chemmove{
   \fill [fill=red, fill opacity=.1,line width=.00pt] ([xshift=0pt,yshift=-10pt]A.south west) rectangle ([xshift=3.5pt,yshift=8pt]B.north east) ;
      \fill [fill=red, fill opacity=.1,line width=.00pt] ([xshift=-8pt,yshift=8pt]B.north west) rectangle ([xshift=-1pt,yshift=6pt]C.north east) ;
            \fill [fill=red, fill opacity=.1,line width=.00pt] ([xshift=11pt,yshift=-8pt]C.south west) rectangle ([xshift=0pt,yshift=13.0pt]D.north east) ;
}\hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{7 Carbons} \end{center}\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{center} \chemfig{CH_3-CH_2-C@{B}H(-[:90]C@{C}H_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3@{D})-CH_3@{E}} \chemmove{
      \fill [fill=red, fill opacity=.1,line width=.00pt] ([xshift=-10pt,yshift=2.6pt]B.north west) rectangle ([xshift=-1pt,yshift=6pt]C.north east) ;
            \fill [fill=red, fill opacity=.1,line width=.00pt] ([xshift=11pt,yshift=-8pt]C.south west) rectangle ([xshift=0pt,yshift=13.0pt]D.north east) ;
               \fill [fill=red, fill opacity=.1,line width=.00pt] ([xshift=-10pt,yshift=-10pt]B.south west) rectangle ([xshift=3.5pt,yshift=9.5pt]E.north east) ;
}\hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{6 Carbons} \end{center}
As the longest chain has seven carbons, the name of the molecule would be heptane. Still you need to add the substituents before that name. After you locate the longest chain you need to number the chain so that the substituents are located the closest to the carbon number one the possible:


\begin{center}\vspace{1cm}\chemfig{@{A}C\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{1}}H_3-C\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{2}}H_2-C\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{3}}@{B}H(-[:90]C\chemabove[2ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{4}}@{C}H_2-C\chemabove[2ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{5}}H_2-C\chemabove[2ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{6}}H_2-C\chemabove[2ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{7}}H_3@{D})-CH_3}\chemmove{
   \fill [fill=red, fill opacity=.1,line width=.00pt] ([xshift=0pt,yshift=-12pt]A.south west) rectangle ([xshift=3.5pt,yshift=8pt]B.north east) ;
      \fill [fill=red, fill opacity=.1,line width=.00pt] ([xshift=-8pt,yshift=8pt]B.north west) rectangle ([xshift=-1pt,yshift=8pt]C.north east) ;
            \fill [fill=red, fill opacity=.1,line width=.00pt] ([xshift=11pt,yshift=-8pt]C.south west) rectangle ([xshift=0pt,yshift=15.0pt]D.north east) ;
}\end{center}

So in carbon number three a methyl is located. Hence the final name of the molecule would be: 3-methylheptane.



\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Name the following hydrocarbon:
\begin{center} \chemfig{CH_3-CH_2-C(-[:90]CH_3)(-[:-90]CH_2-CH_2-CH_3)-CH_3} \end{center}
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
First we locate the longest chain. We have five possible chains, and the longest one has six carbons. Hence the name of the hydrocarbon would be hexane. Now we need to number the carbons so that we start numbering the closes to the substituents the possible.
\begin{center} \chemfig{C\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{1}}H_3-C\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{2}}H_2-C\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{3}}(-[:90]CH_3)(-[:-90]C\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{4}}H_2-C\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{5}}H_2-C\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{red}{6}}H_3)-CH_3} \end{center}\vspace{0.5cm}
We have two methyl connected to carbon number three. Hence the final name will be: 3-dimethylhexane.

\section{\color{blue!30!black}{Cylcoalkanes with substituyents}}
Cycloalkanes are cyclic alkanes. This section covers the naming of cycloalkanes with substituents. The naming rules are the same as the rules for naming alkanes. This means first you will find the ending on the name by counting the number of carbons. Then you will locate each substituent and number the carbon chain so that these substituents are close to carbon number one. All substituents have a number depending on the carbon number. Finally, all substituents should be order according to the \emph{abc}.

\definesubmol\Me[H_3C]{CH_3}
\begin{center}\chemfig{*6(----(-!\Me)---)} \end{center}
this is a cyclohexane connected to a methyl substituent. As there is only one substituents, there is no need to number the carbon chain. Hence the name would be: methylcyclohexane.

\begin{center}\chemfig{*6(---(-F)-(-!\Me)---)} \end{center}
this is a cyclopentane connected to two different substituents: a methyl and a fluoro. In order to name this molecule we need to number the carbons first, and there are two different ways to number the cyclohexane ring:
\definesubmol\A{(-[,-0.3,,,draw=none]\textcolor{red}{1})}
\definesubmol\B{(-[,-0.3,,,draw=none]\textcolor{red}{2})}
\definesubmol\C{(-[,-0.3,,,draw=none]\textcolor{red}{3})}

\chemname{\chemfig{*6((!\E)-(!\D)-(!\C)-(!\B)(-F)-(!\A)(-!\Me)-(!\F)--)} }{(wrong) Fluoro-1-methylcyclohexane}

we will choose the name that gives the lowest numbers: 1-Fluoro-2-methylcyclohexane.

\begin{center}\chemname{\chemfig{*6((!\E)-(!\D)-(!\C)-(!\B)(-F)-(!\A)(-F)-(!\F)--)} }{}\end{center}

\section{\color{blue!30!black}{Molecular diversity}}
The previous sections covered hydrocarbons, either alkanes or cyclocalkanes. Both alkanes and cyclocalkanes are molecules based on carbon and hydrogen. This section will introduce the idea of functional group. You have certainly taken painkillers for a headache or over-the-counter drugs to get over a cold. Maybe you drink coffee and perhaps you like tea. All these medications as well as drinks contain active organic molecules. These active molecules differ from plain  hydrocarbons, which are simply made of carbon and hydrogen. Active molecules contain functional groups such as alcohol, ethers, carboxylic acids, amines, amides or aromatic groups. These groups of atoms have a specific function and give activity to the molecule. The goal of this section is not for you to identify the action mechanisms of these complex active molecules, but simply to identify the different groups.

As both sides of an alkene can be connected to different hydrocarbon chains we normally represent this as:

\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil Carboxylic acids and esters}{Carboxylic acids and esters}] Carboxylic acids contain a carbonyl group (\ce{C=O}) connected to an hydrocarbon and also an alcohol group:
\begin{center}\chemfig{R-C(=[:90]O)(-OH)}\hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{Carboxylic acid}\end{center}
Esters have the same \ce{C=O} group but this time bounded to a carbon (R) and an ether group (\ce{-O-R^{'}}). 
\begin{center}\chemfig{R-C(=[:90]O)-O-R'}\hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{Ester}\end{center}
Examples of carboxylic acids and esters are:

\item[\docfilehook{\smallpencil Amines and amides}{Amines and amides}] Amines and amides are groups containing nitrogen. Amines are derivative of ammonia (\ce{NH3}) with one or more of the hydrogen atoms being replaced by a hydrocarbon
\begin{center}\chemfig{R-N(-[:90]R')(-R'')}\hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{Amine}\end{center}
 All these molecules are amines:

Amides, on the other hand, contain a carbonyl group (\ce{C=O}) connected to an amine group (\chemfig{-N(-)(-[:90])})
\begin{center}  \chemfig{R-C(=[:90]O)(-N(-R')((-[:90]R'')))}  \hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{Amide}\end{center}
Examples of amides are:
\begin{center}\chemfig{CH_3-C(=[:90]O)(-NH_2)}\hspace{1cm} or \hspace{1cm}\chemfig{CH_3-CH_2-C(=[:90]O)-N(-[:90]H)(-CH_3)}\end{center}
